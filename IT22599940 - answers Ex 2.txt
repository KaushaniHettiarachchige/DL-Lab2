1.What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

It increases the network's capacity and it can learn more complex patterns.
It increases training accuracy usually ad hidden units grow with enough units and it may reach ~100%.

2.Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?

With very few hidden units - Both train and test accuracy are low(underfitting)
With moderate hidden units - test accuracy peaks(best generalization)
With very many hidden units - Training accuracy stays high but test accuracy can drop slightly(risk of overfitting, Regularization and more data can help.)
